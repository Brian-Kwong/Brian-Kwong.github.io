    "readmeContent": "# Class Search Demo API\n\nThe following is a simple Express server hosted on Lambda that operates the `Demo Mode` for the Class Search application.\nThere are three primary endpoints:\n\n1. `/*.*.IScript_ClassSearchOptions` - Returns the Class Search options available for this demo university.\n2. `/*.*.IScript_ClassSearchResults` - Returns the Class Search results for a given set of search parameters.\n3. `/*.*.IScript_ClassSearchCourseDetails` - Returns the Class Search course details for a given course.\n\n## Setup\n\nIf you would like to run this server locally, you will need to have Node.js and npm installed on your machine. Additionally please make a MongoDB instance either locally or in the cloud using a provider such as MongoDB Atlas.\n\nNext follow to run the server, please follow these steps:\n\n1. Clone this repository to your local machine.\n2. Navigate to the project directory.\n3. Run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies.\n4. Create a `.env` file in the root of the project and add the following environment variables:\n   ```\n   MONGODB_URI=<Your MongoDB URI>\n   SEARCH_OPTIONS_URL=<Your Search Options URL>\n   SEARCH_RESULTS_URL=<Your Search Results URL>\n   COURSE_DETAILS_URL=<Your Course Details URL>\n   ```\n5. Run `serverless offline start` to start the server locally.\n6. The server should now be running on `http://localhost:3000`.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> You will need to make the MongoDB database before you can run the server. Run `npm run make-db` to create the database and populate it with sample data provided in the `data` folder. If you would like to use your own data, you can modify the CSV files in the `data` folder before re-running the command.\n\n7. You can test the endpoints using a tools such as Postman or cURL. Alternatively open your web browser and navigate to the endpoints. If you would like to test with Class Search modify the `Demo` attribute in the redirect object in `csuLinks.ts` to `http://localhost:3000/`.\n\n8. To stop the server, press `Ctrl + C` in the terminal.\n\n## Deployment\n\nTo deploy the server to AWS Lambda, you will need to have the Serverless account and configured to be linked with your AWS account. You can follow the instructions [here](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/getting-started/).\n\n> [!TIP]\n> Run `npm install -g serverless` to install the Serverless CLI globally. This makes it available for all terminal instances and any future projects you may create.\n\nAfterwards run `serverless login` to login to your Serverless account.\n\nOnce you have the Serverless CLI set up, you can deploy the server by running the following command in the project directory: `serverless deploy`.\n\nRefer to Class Search [repo](https://github.com/Brian-Kwong/ClassSearch) and [documentation](https://brian-kwong.github.io/ClassSearch/getting-started.html) for additional configuration required to use the Demo Mode.\n",

The helpful ingredients app for all your recipe needs.\n\nFoodScanner is an android app that helps you come up with recipes based on whatever ingredients you have lying around.\n\n* Take pictures and use ✨machine learning✨ to determine the ingredients\n* Manual input of ingredients and amount\n* Step-by-step guide to creating said recipes\n\n## Design\n\n<img width=\"1032\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f429963c-c13d-49a3-9bb8-70391ce2b024\" />\n\n## Dependencies\n* [CameraX](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/camera)\n* [Tensorflow](https://ai.google.dev/edge/litert)\n* [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/)\n* [Gson](https://github.com/google/gson)\n* [Coil](https://github.com/coil-kt/coil)\n\n## Jetpack Compose Features\n* ViewModel\n* Navigation\n\n## Running the App\n\nVisit our [App Website](https://staging.d2fhzzegitvejc.amplifyapp.com/)\n\n1. The app does use a food API provided by RapidAPI so you will need an API key for that.\n  - The [APK](https://staging.d2fhzzegitvejc.amplifyapp.com/static/media/app-release.c03141fd43f96a8ce273.apk) has the API lib embedded, but if you prefer to build it yourself\n    1. Make sure you have CMake and NDK installed in Andriod Studio `Tools > SDK Manager > SDK Tools`\n    2. Obtain the cpp file from Slack\n    3. Make a `cpp` folder in `app/src/main` and paste the provided `.cpp` file here\n    4. Rebuild the application\n        - Should look like this\n  ```\n├── AndroidManifest.xml\n├── assets\n│   └── model.tflite\n├── cpp\n│   └── api-key.cpp <----- File goes here\n├── ic_launcher-playstore.png\n├── java\n│   └── com\n│       └── zybooks\n│           └── foodscanner\n│               ├── ImageProcessor.kt\n│               ├── MainActivity.kt\n│               ├── data\n│               │   ├── Ingredients.kt\n│               │   ├── Recipe.kt\n│               │   ├── RecipeAPIService.kt\n│               │   └── RecipeDetails.kt\n│               └── ui\n│                   ├── AddIngredientsScreen.kt\n│                   ├── AddViewModel.kt\n│                   ├── CameraScreen.kt\n│                   ├── CameraScreenViewModel.kt\n│                   ├── DetailedRecipeScreen.kt\n│                   ├── ImagePicker.kt\n│                   ├── RecipeTablePage.kt\n│                   ├── RecipeViewModel.kt\n│                   └── theme\n│                       ├── Color.kt\n│                       ├── Theme.kt\n│                       └── Type.kt\n└── res\n    ├── drawable\n    │   ├── ic_launcher_background.xml\n    │   └── ic_launcher_foreground.xml\n    ├── mipmap-anydpi-v26\n    │   ├── ic_launcher.xml\n    │   └── ic_launcher_round.xml\n    ├── mipmap-hdpi\n    │   ├── ic_launcher.webp\n    │   ├── ic_launcher_foreground.webp\n    │   └── ic_launcher_round.webp\n    ├── mipmap-mdpi\n    │   ├── ic_launcher.webp\n    │   ├── ic_launcher_foreground.webp\n    │   └── ic_launcher_round.webp\n    ├── mipmap-xhdpi\n    │   ├── ic_launcher.webp\n    │   ├── ic_launcher_foreground.webp\n    │   └── ic_launcher_round.webp\n    ├── mipmap-xxhdpi\n    │   ├── ic_launcher.webp\n    │   ├── ic_launcher_foreground.webp\n    │   └── ic_launcher_round.webp\n    ├── mipmap-xxxhdpi\n    │   ├── ic_launcher.webp\n    │   ├── ic_launcher_foreground.webp\n    │   └── ic_launcher_round.webp\n    ├── values\n    │   ├── colors.xml\n    │   ├── ic_launcher_background.xml\n    │   ├── secrets.xml\n    │   ├── strings.xml\n    │   └── themes.xml\n    └── xml\n        ├── backup_rules.xml\n        └── data_extraction_rules.xml\n         \n```\n\n  \n3. Make sure you are using Android 7.1 Nougat 🍫 or higher with at least API Level 25.\n\n## Model\n\nThe dataset we trained our model originally from was based on a food computer vision dataset found on [Roboflow](https://universe.roboflow.com/food-recipe-ingredient-images-0gnku/food-ingredients-dataset)  While there are direct trained models available on Roboflow, we decided to use [Google's TensorFlow model maker](https://ai.google.dev/edge/litert/libraries/modify/object_detection) to train the model as it is more efficient to run on mobile devices with limited compute capability.  The [model training](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1RnakbpL7GSO0hmTB3mH0_pHYJby18jND?usp=drive_link) occurs in Python and is exported as a `.tflite` file which we integrated into Kotlin with the Tensor Flow Lite Vision API for Android to execute the model \n\nIf you would like to train the model yourself, make sure to have `python 3.9`, `tensorflow 2.09`, and `tflite-model-maker` installed.  For GPU acceleration you will also need the `CUDA 11.1` toolkit installed. Then run `model2.py` to train the model.  Model training could take upwards of 8+ hours depending on available GPU/CPU power.  Lower your batch size or change to a lower-end model such as `efficientdet_lite0` or `efficientdet_lite1` if you run into VRAM issues, though accuracy could degrade.\n\n",

It's designed to enhance your focus and productivity which will help you study for classes.\n\n## Product Vision\n\nFor students who need effective study habits, StudyBuddy is a study management app that provides personalized study and break timers, reminders for assignments, and focus-enhancing music. Unlike traditional timer apps or generic productivity tools, our product integrates all essential features into a single platform specifically designed for students, making it easier to manage their study time efficiently and enjoyably.\n\n## Lofi Music Sources\n\n<a>https://pixabay.com/music/search/lofi/</a>\n\n## Prototype\n\nhttps://www.figma.com/file/kfvBoWzSjIklABaIzf1QbJ/StudyBuddy?type=design&node-id=1%3A40&mode=dev&t=m9tIXMnVUoiSo60m-1\n\n## Cloning the repo\n\nUse your favourite Git GUI to clone the project down to to local machine\n\nIf you perfer to do this in the terminal run `git clone git@github.com:Brian-Kwong/Pawsitive-Studying-.git` in the directory you would like the project to be located in\n\n## Running the Application\n\nRun `npm install` which downloads all the neccessary node packages\n\nThis application's front end was built upon the React Native framework so we will need to install a couple more things...\n\nIf you're using a Mac you'll also need to install watchman `brew install watchman`[^1]\n\nAfterwards we will need to allow Watchman to have permission on your computer:\n\n1. Open the `Privacy & Security` section of system settings and then click `Full Disk Access`\n2. Click the plus icon to add a new application\n3. Press (SHIFT+COMMAND+G) then type in the following path `/opt/homebrew/Cellar/watchman/`\n4. Open the folder with your version number for example : `2024.04.22.00_1` followed by entering the bin folder\n5. Select `watchman`\n6. Restart your terminal or run `exec zsh`\n\n[^1]: This assumes you have homebrew (the package manager for macOS) installed. If you dont have it installed you can get it [here](https://brew.sh/)\n\nAdditionally we will need to get a ExpoGo-- an app that allows us to wirelessly transmit our web application to our mobile device.\n\n[iOS📱](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/expo-go/id982107779)\n[Andriod ☎️](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent&hl=en_US&gl=US&pli=1)\n\nThen to start the application navigate to `./Application/Pawsitive-Studying` & run `npx expo start`[^2]\n\n[^2]: **_IMPORTANT_** If you are using Eduroam or any public network, run ` npx expo start --tunnel`. This creates a private tunnel between your computer and device to bypass any firewall restrictions\n\nMake sure your mobile phone and computer are connected on the same LAN, then scan the QR code.\n\nAccept any permission prompts that may arise from either the computer or device.\n\nIf all goes well it should open up in ExpoGo and load your app[^3].\n[^3]: On first boot it may take a bit to download the code onto the device\n\n## Database Schema :\nFor this project, we went with a document-based database system, in the form of MongoDB, as there are few relations, and the relations we have are either compositions or can easily be linked together using ObjectIDs.  Using a relational-based DB like MySQL would require many excess tables to maintain the schema in 3NF causing an unnecessary number of joins, anytime a user uses the app.\nWith that in mind, we built the following schema for our application :\n\n![Databse ERD](./assets/ERD.png \"Database ERD\")\n",

The traditional economic policy would suggest that free democratic and honest governments like those in North America and Western Europe would have the highest GDP per Capita, but in the past 40 years countries in the Middle East and Asia have witnessed rapid economic growth and corresponding dramatic increasing GDP per Capita authoritarian and opaque government finances.  Is it the case then still that in the 21st century that lower absence of corruption leads to higher GDP per capita?\n\n## Data Used In Report\n\nThe data studied throughout this report is provided by [GapMinder's 2023 IDEA-Democracy Indices Data - v5](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jYUZFQOQrE0bAjV9XVgr_92nMT-_ukYBs4Uom4rfVtQ/edit#gid=501532268&range=B17) and we would be focusing on the following variables:\n\n| Variable | Type | Description |\n|--|--|--|\n| 🔑Country | String | Full Name of a Country |\n| 🔑Year | Int | Year This data was collected\n| Country's Absence of Corruption Index | Optional(Double) | An index measuring how corrupt a perceived country's government is.  Lower value means less trust and more corruption.  NA means no data is unavailable for that year.  Please check the section about NA values for some possible reasons |\n| GDP Per Capita | Double | Calculated GDP per Captia (GDP/Population) in USD\n\nEntries from the dataset have been limited to the years of 1975-2021 inclusive as 2021 is the most recent available data for a country's Absence of Corruption Index\n\n## How to Run & Obtain a Copy of the Report\n\nThis report is stored on GitHub and can be accessed by cloning the repository using GitHub Desktop, R-Studio GUI environment, Git CLI, or downloading the project as a ZIP\n\nFor GitHub Desktop simply hit the open in GitHub Desktop option under the green clone button from the main repository. Once it’s done click “Show in Folder” and take note of where the project has been cloned to. Then proceed to R Studio and open the .Rproj file from the open project in the menu bar and open the Quarto Document of the report located in the Src Folder[^1]\n\n[^1]: For some versions of GitHub desktop there may be a direct option to open in R Studio \n\n\nFor R Studio users clone the project by creating a new project, then selecting the Version Control option from the menu.  Then copy the HTTPS URL from the green clone button of the main repository [^2].\n[^2]: You will need to already have established a connection with GitHub through R Studio ie: auth token before cloning.\n\nFor Git CLI users open your terminal and run `git –version` to make sure you have Git Installed. macOS and Linux users should have this installed by default while Windows box users will need to obtain a copy of [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) from their official website.  Afterwards you can `cd`[^3], into your desired directory and run `git clone git@github.com:Brian-Kwong/STAT-331-Final-Project-Group6.git` to get a copy of the project[^4].  Then proceed to R Studio and open the .Rproj file from the open project in the menu bar and open the Quarto Document of the report located in the Src Folder\n\n[^3]: The cd or change directory command is the standard Unix command for changing around directories(folders) using the terminal.  It also works on Windows too!\n\n[^4]: Since early 2022 GitHub CLI has required SSH authentication for cloning of repositories. [Learn how to set up SSH Keys for GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent)\n\nLastly, you could just download the zip file, by clicking download as zip option from the green clone button of the main repository, copy the folder to a desired location, and unzip. Then proceed to R Studio and open the .Rproj file from the open project in the menu bar and open the Quarto Document of the report located in the Src Folder\n\nPlease note to run this project successfully the following R Libraries will need to be installed all of which can be found in the Crayon Package Manager\n\n1. Tidyverse\n2. Here\n3. Janitor\n4. Styler\n5. Reactablefmtr\n6. Gganimate\n7. Gifski\n8. Formattable\n\nThis code chuck should do the trick in downloading all the necessary packages \n```{r}\ninstall.packages(“tidyverse”)\ninstall.packages(\"janitor\")\ninstall.packages(\"styler\")\ninstall.packages(\"reactablefmtr\")\ninstall.packages(\"gganimate\")\ninstall.packages(\"gifski\")\ninstall.packages(\"formattable\")\n```\n\nLastly please note as this project has quite a few graphics and one 5,000 simulation, rendering and running of the document could take upwards of 10 seconds depending on the processing performance of your computer.\n",

    "readmeContent": "# Tabby : Chrome Extension for organizing tabs\n\n---\n\n## Inspiration\n  \n  - Our team believes that effective organization leads to an improvement in education, workforce, and in public health.  We developed our project to help others stay   organized. \n\n  - Being disorganized may cause stress and discomfort that may lead to a reduction in our productivity and motivation. Our program does the dirty work so you can worry about the important things. \n\n## What it does\n   - Whether it's working on homework or hacking our next hackathon, the swamp of tabs causes too much clutter and confusion. In all the messiness, why bother sorting your tabs when Tabby can do it for you? Our cute Tabby cat serves as your personal assistant to group all of your tabs automatically. Tabby can group your tabs either by domain name or by categories through AI-based clustering algorithms. \n\n## How we built it\n  - We evenly divided ourselves to work on the website and the AI model simultaneously. We created a Google Chrome extension integrated with an AI model to recognize key terms and group tabs accordingly. \n\n## Challenges we ran into\n- Creating artwork, design. and UI.\n- Working with Google and AI APIs.\n- Develop vectors for K-means clustering.\n- No food :c (no money, no housing, no break)\n\n\n## Accomplishments that we're proud of\n- Cute artwork.\n- Practical to use in everyday tasks.\n- Consistently functional and reliable.\n- We finished! :P\n\n## What we learned\n- How to create Google Chrome extensions.\n- Utilizing AI APIs to create K-means clustering.\n- Working as a team! :D\n\n## Running the AI Model\n\n- You will need Python 3 installed on your computer along with the following pip modules\n```\npip install sentence-transformers\npip install flask\npip install flask-restful\npip install flask-cors\n```\n\nThen to start the AI\n```\npython3 ./backend/api.py\n```\n\n\n\n\nWhat's next for Tabby\nImprove on AI model for better consistency\nCustomization colors for group tabs.\nMore efficient and optimal AI models.\n",

The magical fairies quickly flock to replenish such sinful and harmful actions to nature. All were curious of the pure origin of these mysterious dudes, not obeying instructions, purple in appearance and most importantly their obsession into one of the most stressful and energy intensive tasks: touching grass. It's only when you click the screen do you truly reveal the dark secrets behind these mystifying foresters. These are NOT dudes at all!! Ahhhhh  It was a disguise all along.  Who knew these creatures were up to such devilish acts… Beneath those ragged farm outfits, these fierce and hungry bears were furious that the big had wolf and his fairy tailed derived creatures of yellow cream puff shaped kept muching down upon their houses when they were simply to enjoy their morning porridge. Annoyed at the fairies persistently hiding their favorite honey in the tallest of trees they wreak havoc on the forest, killing more trees than even the most wasteful of individuals. The magical fairies, horrified by the fate of the future habitat, quickly turn the houses into boba shops and call Zuko’s  and Mochi’s best friend(s): BobaCat!! uWu .  With the power of sugar cone boba and 30% strawberry latte milk tea, these magical kitties have come in to save the world from these destructive bears. The bears are vicious, fiercely firing their honey infused bear bullets wildly across the already battered battlefield, but despite the rough conditions, bobaCat has strong determination to fight on until the end : where peace is restored in this dystopian universe of Virtual World.\n\n# Controls\nUP- Moves camera angle up 1 pixel\n<br />DOWN- Moves camera angle down 1 pixel\n<br />LEFT- Moves camera angle left 1 pixel\n<br />RIGHT- Moves camera angle right 1 pixel\n<br />R-Resets the world\n<br />SPACE- Spawns new dudes (If a house is in a cave then spawns bears instead)\n\n\n# Creators :\nAma : amandayu255 <br /> Brian\n\n",
