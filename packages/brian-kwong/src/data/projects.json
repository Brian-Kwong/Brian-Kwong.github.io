Enhance your course registration process with ClassSearch, an interactive desktop application that brings the power of the university data with the user experience of a modern web application.  ClassSearch provides numerous searching parameters and a direct connection with PolyRatings, allowing for informed data-driven class enrollment decisions, all built upon standard contemporary web technologies.",
